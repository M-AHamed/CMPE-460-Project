# CMPE-460-Project
Project for DEEP Learning course (CMPE 460). Implemented via a vanilla Neural Network, which consists of 4 total layers. The main library used was Keras Tensorflow.
Aim of project is to give an estimation of the car price based on its features.
The project takes data from the following dataset: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction".
The Gui is responsible for handling the user input, and formatting it in a way that the data can be inputted to the model to be used by the model.
Gui displays the result of the prediciton perfomred by the model after submitting the features.
