# CMPE-460-Project
Project for DEEP Learning class. Involves neural networks. Aim of project is accuratley predict the price of a car based on its features.
The project takes data from the following dataset: "". The neural network is trained on the dataset. The gui is responsible for handling the user input, and formatting it in a way that the data can be inputted to the model to be used by the model.
Gui displays the result of the prediciton perfomred by the model.
